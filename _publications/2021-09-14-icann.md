title: "Attention-Based Bi-LSTM for Anomaly Detection on Time-Series Data"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-icann
excerpt: 'Existing work in the field of anomaly detection for time-series data has primarily focused on developing intelligent systems that use dimensionality reduction or regression-based approaches to annotate data based on a certain static threshold. Researchers in fields such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV) have realized considerable improvement by incorporating attention in prediction-related tasks. This work explores the use of an Attention-Bi-LSTM for anomaly detection on time-series data.'
