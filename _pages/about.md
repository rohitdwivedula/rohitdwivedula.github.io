Hi! I'm Rohit Dwivedula, a recent computer science graduate from BITS Pilani - Hyderabad Campus, India. I'm currently working as a Research Fellow at [Microsoft Research - India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) under the guidance of [Muthian Sivathanu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/muthian/) in the broad area of systems for deep neural networks. 

During my undergrad, I have been fortunate to have been mentored by [Prof. Narasimha Bolloju](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/narasimhabolloju/Profile), [Prof. Chittaranjan Hota](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/chittaranjanhota/Profile), and [Prof. K Srinivasa Raju](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/ksraju/Profile), while working on research projects in software development management, deep learning for anomaly detection, and applications of multiobjective optimisation, respectively. I wrote my undergraduate thesis as a Research Intern at Microsoft Research, working on [Project Blockene](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/blockene/), under the guidance of [Divya Gupta](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/digup/), [Nishanth Chandran](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/nichandr/), [Satya Lokam](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/satya/) and [Muthian Sivathanu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/muthian/).
