Hi! I'm a first-year Ph.D. student at UT Austin's [Networked Systems Lab](https://utns.cs.utexas.edu/), advised by [Prof. Aditya Akella](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~akella/) and [Prof. Daehyeok Kim](https://daehyeok.kim/). I am working on efforts that attempt to understand (1) where we can use learned models (e.g. ML) in the operating system and how such models can be trained using rich systems traces, and (2) as a more immediate step, how such traces can be collected, represented and used. 

From 2021 - 2023, I worked as a research fellow at Microsoft Research, India in the SysML team broadly focussed on optimizing DNN training and inference. Before that, during my undergraduate at BITS Pilani (India), I worked on projects in bioinformatics, optimization, anomaly detection, systems and cryptography while exploring what research areas fascinate me.
