Hi! I'm a Ph.D. student at UT Austin's [Networked Systems Lab](https://utns.cs.utexas.edu/), advised by [Prof. Aditya Akella](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~akella/) and [Prof. Daehyeok Kim](https://daehyeok.kim/). Prior to joining UT Austin, I spent two years as a research fellow at Microsoft Research, India, working on optimizing DNN training and inference. Before that, I was an undergraduate student in BITS Pilani - Hyderabad Campus, and I worked on a project at the intersection of systems and cryptography for my undergraduate thesis.
