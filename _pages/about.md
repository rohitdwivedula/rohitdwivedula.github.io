Hi! I am a third-year Ph.D. student at UT Austin's [Networked Systems Lab](https://utns.cs.utexas.edu/), advised by [Prof. Aditya Akella](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~akella/) and [Prof. Daehyeok Kim](https://daehyeok.kim/). I am part of the [Learning Directed Operating Systems](https://ldos.utexas.edu/) project, where I focus on making modern autonomous mobile service robots (AMSRs) more performant through improving abstractions and resource management in ROS.

Previously, I worked as a research fellow at Microsoft Research India (2021 -- 2023) and majored in computer science at BITS Pilani - Hyderabad Campus, India (2017 -- 2021).
